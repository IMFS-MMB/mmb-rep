Variant 1: US_CFP17exo
In this variant, the amount of bonds held by the financial intermediaries and the central bank (comparable to QE) can vary exogenously. 

Variant 2: US_CFP17_endo
In this variant of the model, the term premium is fixed to a certain value (=0), instead the amount of bonds varies endogenously.

The replication file generates figure 3 of the original paper, showing responses of both model versions to an investment shock.
