The file US_IN10_rep includes the code for both flexible economy and sticky price and sticky wages economy.
The flexible economy code was added by M. Lalik and A. Mazany.
The sticky price and sticky wages code was taken from Matteo Iacoviello website: https://www2.bc.edu/~iacoviel/.
The part of the original code referring to the estimation routines was removed.

eps_j - is a housing preference shock. IRFs displayed on page 141
