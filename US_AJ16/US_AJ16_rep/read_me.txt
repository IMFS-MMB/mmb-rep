+ replicated IRFs correspond to Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 of the article

+  Literature: 	Andrea Ajello (2016): "Financial Intermediation, Investment Dynamics and Business Cycle Fluctuations"
                American Economic Review, Vol 106 (8), pp.2256-2303

+ Notes on the replication:
	- For replicating Fig 6,7,8 parameters on the price/wage stickiness have to be adjusted 	
	  accordingly
	- run.m scales the variables appropriately as in the figures displayed in the picture
	- it also allows to take care of rescaling variables when simulating technology shock, which is       	 
      necessary since variables have been scaled by technology to account for a unit root
	- further code is available from the author on the AER webpage
