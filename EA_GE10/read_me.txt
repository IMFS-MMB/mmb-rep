+ replication: IRF to a monetary policy shock 
               IRF to a technology shock
               IRF to a investment specific shock
               IRF to a labor supply shock	
Note: the IRFs in the paper are Bayesian impulse responses, 
    	hence the replicated impulse responses do not match the IRFs in the paper precisely, 
	but they do match qualitatively
