GPM6_IMF13 Replication

+ last change: 2016-03-02

+ replication: IRF to TFP shock
               IRF to monetary policy shock
               IRF to row output shock
               IRF to bank net worth shock	
Note: the IRFs in the paper are Bayesian impulse responses, 
    hence the replicated impulse responses do not match the IRFs in the paper precisely;
    the impulse responses for monetary, TOT, row output and row inflatuion shock do qualitatively match the
    IRFs in the paper; we are not able to qualitatively replicate the IRFs for the technology shock
        

+ replicated IRFs: irf_fig_1_FA.pdf is the financial accelerator case in fig 1.    

+ file to produce replicated IRFs: run.m (which calls NK_GK11_rep.mod in the folder NK_GK11_rep)
